# Module-1-Challenge-

For this week's challenge, we were given a working html and css code and given tasks so that the codebase follows accessibility standards and the webpage is optimized for search engines.

To begin with, I had made sections comments on the html and css code so that I can easiliy identiy which part of the webpage/html. Then I had renamed the class id's to a more sensible name. For instance, I had changed the class id of "div" to "nav" for the navigation bar, "main" for the main body, "aside" for the sidebar, and "footer" for the footer section of teh webpage. To add more to that, I had condensed a portion of the css code as I find that it was repetitive. In this case, the sidebar's side class id from "lead", "brand" and "cost" and condensed that all into a class id of "icon".

Secondly, I had made the Digital Marketing Image into its own section so that it is independent from the css coding. With each image of the webpage, I had added labels so that the reader can identify which image they are looking for.
